# 🕳️ Rabbit Hole

**Rabbit Hole** is a curated collection of useful, weird, and genuinely good links — a place to get lost on purpose.

No algorithms.  
No trackers.  
No feed optimization.  
Just links worth clicking.

## ✨ What is this?

Rabbit Hole is a lightweight website that organizes hand-picked websites and resources into clear categories.  
It’s meant for exploration, curiosity, and productivity — whether you’re bored, learning something new, or looking for a specific tool.

Think of it as:

- a personal internet index
- a boredom cure
- a curated bookmark vault that doesn’t suck

## 🔍 Features

- **Category filtering** – quickly narrow down what you’re looking for
- **A–Z sorting** – predictable, alphabetical order
- **Search** – searches titles and descriptions
- **Pagination** – capped rendering (max 100 links) for performance
- **Responsive layout** – works on desktop and mobile
- **No backend required** – pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 🧭 Philosophy

- Curated > infinite
- Simple > clever
- Human > algorithmic
- Fast > flashy

Rabbit Hole is intentionally opinionated and minimal.
If something doesn’t earn its place, it doesn’t belong here.
